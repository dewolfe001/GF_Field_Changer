# GF_Field_Changer
Gravity Forms Field Changer to allow users to swap from one field type to the next, keeping the same form ID# and as many of the attributes as will map over

Allows you to edit one existing field to keep the ID# the same, but change the field to a different field type. 

Change one existing field to preserve some of the same information, but blank out field specific settings when converted to the new field type. This is handy if your submission process already holds a field definition and uses in a difficult to replace part of your form creation.
